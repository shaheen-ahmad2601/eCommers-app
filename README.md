## [Design Decisions](#design-decisions)
I started by designing the overall layout, ensuring a clean and organized structure. To improve clarity, I divided the layout into distinct sections. Attention to pixel-perfect precision was key, ensuring proper alignment and consistent spacing across different devices. I also focused on typography and color schemes that enhanced readability and aligned with the brand.

## [Challenges Faced](#challenges-faced)
One of the main challenges was ensuring the layout remained responsive across various screen sizes, which required constant testing and adjustments. Achieving pixel-perfect precision for elements like spacing, alignment, and typography was another hurdle. Additionally, balancing design aesthetics with functionality was tricky, as it required careful consideration of user experience while maintaining a visually appealing interface.

## [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)

Tailwind CSS was utilized for rapid styling, offering flexibility and ease in creating custom designs. JavaScript was used for adding interactivity, while HTML5 and CSS3 provided the foundation for the structure and styling. For state management, Redux was integrated to manage the global state efficiently across components
